# DD/86 Technical Reference Manual Source

For educational and exploration purposes, this is an effort to bring the manual
to LaTeX. Feel free to hint me as I'm learning LaTeX, like best practices, or
suggestions.

Current phase: Learning basics

Please note that this project will remain license-less as long as I'm learning
LaTeX and writing the manual.

A daily build (midnight UTC-05) is available [here](https://dd86k.space/docs/drafts/dd86-manual.pdf).
The original manual is available [here](https://dd86k.space/docs/dd86-manual.pdf).
