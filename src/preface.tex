\chapter*{Preface}

Aimed at programmers, engineers, the curious mind, and myself, this document is
about the internal technical details of the DD/86 project. It was initially
written for myself as a memory aid from various documentation online and
manuals. It may also be called as "DD/86 bible" for short and it is currently
being written entirely by dd86k (\url{https://github.com/dd86k}) in \LaTeX.
\\\\
This manual is meant to be distributed freely. If you bought a copy, you got
swindled!
\\\\
Any comments, additions, suggestions, and fixes can be sent to my email
(\url{mailto:dd@dax.moe}), or by creating an issue on Gitbucket or Github with
the label "Technical Manual". I appreciate them!
\\\\
I hope you enjoy the manual, happy reading!
